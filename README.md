# hao-ontology
The Health  Analysis  Ontology  (HAO)  captures  the data domain and analysis workflow in cartridges that represent domain knowledge, analytics knowledge, and other components of the analysis pipeline. We leverage existing and novel ontolo-gies to formally specify concepts and relationships. In the HAO,this is done by declaratively encoding background and analysis domain knowledge in cartridges and then instantiating them in the knowledge graph. The KG captures all domain knowledge necessary for the use of NHANES and the specification of the population health study. The cartridges allow many different components  of  data  science  workflows  to  be  automatically generated  at  execution  time.  Example  components  include the  definition  of  the  problem,  filtering  criteria  for  the  data, selection of the modeling method, execution of the analysis, and presentation of the results.
